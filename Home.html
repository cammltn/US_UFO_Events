                    <h4>An Exploration of Life Beyond Earth...</h4>
                    <p class="left-align ">Earlier last year the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) declassified and released nearly 3,000 pages of the agencyâ€™s findings on UFOs, a massive step in 
                        legitimizing existing and further research into the topic. The subject has been considered by many to be one of fiction or unexplained mystery that humanity may never truly understand, 
                        but this data can quickly change that perspective. The CIA along with other government agencies have collected over 60 years of data on unexplained aerial flying objects. 
                        Now that this data is public experts and enthusiasts can further this research to better explain what many have claimed to have seen or experienced. 
                        Numerous organizations and individuals have worked to sort through the massive amount of data to provide more accessible summaries and reports for the average user.  
                        There are many websites that cover UFOs and alien life, but there are few that present real data in a way that is accessible for the average user to access and explore 
                        UFO sightings that have been reported across the country. </p>
                        <p class="left-align ">The purpose of this project is to make data on UFO sightings more accessible to the average user/enthusiast. The goal of this project is to make the 
                        data collected over the past few decades user friendly to encourage more people to take a deeper look into what could be beyond life here on Earth. 
                        Given the further validation from the U.S government it is the perfect time to explore what has in many cases been dismissed as fiction in the past.
                        This application features three pages, <b>Map</b> an interactive map of geocoded UFO sighting reports from June 1400 - January 2021, <b>Resources</b> a list of news articles and 
                        releases government documents to learn more about documented experiences with unexplained crafts/beings, and this introductary <b>Home</b> page.

                <p class="left-align ">This project was created using data collected by the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). The NUFORC hmaintains a comprehensive user submitted UFO 
                    sighting database. The NUFORC provides monthly datasets beginning with June 1400 to January 2021. I compiled this data and filtered for reports made in the U.S. only and geocoded
                    the data for use in ArcGIS. The resulting layer file was then accessed from an ArcGIS server to create the interactive map on the <b>Map</b> tab.</p>
